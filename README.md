![Project setup](imgs/project_image.png)

## Overview
This project explores the application of advanced AI techniques to enhance industrial safety with the ABB IRB 1200 robotic system and Intel RealSense D415 camera. Supervised by Mathias Verbeke and Matthias De Ryck at KU Leuven, Faculty of Engineering Technology, this work is a significant part of the academic curriculum for the Master of AI in Business and Industry, academic year 2023-2024.

## Project Description
The main objective of this study is to assess and improve the reliability of AI systems in industrial environments. By integrating computer vision and robotics, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and safety of industrial robots during operation.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach involving several key stages:
1. **Image Acquisition and Preprocessing**: Using the Intel RealSense D415, raw images are captured and processed to correct distortions and generate masks.
2. **3D Object Localization**: Objects are located in 3D space by transforming camera coordinates to robot base coordinates.
3. **Tool and Camera Calibration**: Continuous calibration updates to account for tool wear and camera shifts.
4. **Uncertainty Handling**: Techniques to manage and mitigate uncertainty in robot operations are explored, including runtime monitoring and predictive uncertainty estimation using neural networks.
